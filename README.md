# System-Identification-Project

## Description
## Part 1
The task requires implementing the polynomial approximator and regression procedure in MATLAB, trying different degrees of approximators to obtain the most accurate one. Validation is performed on a separate validation dataset to assess the model's performance. Mean squared errors are reported for both datasets, and representative plots comparing true values to approximator outputs are shown. The results are discussed, considering the choice of degree and the quality of the model fit on both datasets, with regard to model choice and overfitting in regression.

## Part 2

The task requires creating a model for an unknown dynamic system with one input and one output. The system's dynamics are nonlinear, with a maximum order of three. Additionally, the output may be influenced by noise. To model this system, a polynomial nonlinear ARX (AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs) model is selected. This model represents the input-output relationship using a polynomial function of delayed inputs and outputs.
